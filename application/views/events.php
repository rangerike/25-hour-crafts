      Kayla and Scott travel all around the upper Midwest to various nerdy craft fairs, geeky conventions, comic cons, etc.
      to bring their handmade crafts to those who would enjoy them the most. For us, traveling is definitely less fun than
      the destination especially with all the amazing costumes, other nerdy and geeky crafters, fun people, and talented artists we see.
      We've also been invited to conventions further afield like in Las Vegas(!), but for now, we're sticking a bit closer to home
      especially since travelling with stuff to sell is harder than a regular trip.
