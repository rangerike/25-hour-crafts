    <h1 class="m3 center h2 italic">Handmade Nerdy &amp; Geeky Crafts</h1>
    <p class="m3 h3 bold">
      If we had another hour in the day, we would use it to craft!
    </p>
    <p class="m3 ampstart-dropcap">
      Whether you're looking for a piece of jewelry to subtly show off your nerdy side, a licensed character cotton
      or chainmaille dicebag to hold all those gaming dice or a gift for that lovable geek in your life, 25th Hour Crafts
      has something just for you!
    </p>
    <p class="m3">
      Everything we sell is handmade by either Kayla or Scott and the ideas and fabric we use take ample hints from your favorite
      video game, movie, TV series, or book. Some of the ones we use as the material for our crafts are The Legend of Zelda,
      Pokemon, Mario, The Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Dr. Who, Star Trek, Game of Thrones, and Harry Potter, however, that's
      not even close to an exhaustive list.
    </p>
    <p class="m3">
      These hand-crafted nerdy items take the form of cute crocheted Amigurumi, cotton drawstring or zipper dicebags with soft liners,
      themed chainmail dicebags using specific color palettes like the House Colors from Harry Potter and patterns like the Triforce,
      comic book hero earrings like Wonder Woman, Batman, or Superman, and licensed fleece with a crocheted edge and not a tied edge
      (we don't like how tied fleece looks either). If geeky crafts are more your thing, we do make steampunk charm necklaces and earrings
      along with many other types of charms to match your personal style.
    </p>
    <p class="m3">
      We keep many of the aforementioned items in stock for when we travel to conventions around the upper midwest
      so you should check out our <a href="<?=absolute_url()?>events">Events</a> page for where we'll be next to come visit us,
      however, we can also send it right to your door if you aren't able to catch us at one of them so just give us a shout and we'll send it out!
    </p>
    <p class="m3">
      As well, we're always looking for new conventions to vend at, so if you would like to see us come to your city, send an email to
      us at one of the email addresses on our <a href="<?=absolute_url()?>contact">Contact</a> page and we'll get back to you quickly
      on whether we are available and able to travel there.
