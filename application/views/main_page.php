    <h1 class="m3 center h4 italic">Handmade Nerdy &amp; Geeky Crafts</h1>
    <p class="m3 h3 bold">
      The only limit to our crafts is imagination! And the laws of physics, but we like to think it's only imagination.
    </p>
    <p class="m3 ampstart-dropcap">
      Whether you&#39;re looking for a piece of jewelry to subtly show off your nerdy side, a licensed character cotton
      or chainmaille bag to hold all those gaming dice, or a gift for that lovable geek in your life, 25th Hour Crafts
      has something just for you!
    </p>
    <p class="m3">
      Everything we sell is handmade by either Kayla or Scott and the ideas and fabric take ample hints from your favorite
      video game, movie, TV series, or book. Some of the ones we use as the material for our crafts are The Legend of Zelda,
      Pokemon, Mario, The Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Dr. Who, Star Trek, Game of Thrones, and Harry Potter though that's
      not even close to an exhaustive list.
    </p>
    <p class="m3">
      These hand-crafted nerdy items take the form of cute Amigurumi, licensed cotton drawstring or zipper bags,
      themed chainmail dice bags using specific color palettes like the House Colors from Harry Potter and patterns like the Triforce,
      comic book hero logo earrings like Wonder Woman, Batman, or Superman, and licensed fleece with a crocheted edge and not a tied edge
      (we don't like how tied fleece looks either). If geeky crafts are more your thing, we do make steampunk charm necklaces and earrings
      along with many other types of charms to match your personal style.
    </p>
    <p class="m3">
      Many of these items we keep in stock for when we travel to conventions around the upper midwest
      so you should check out our <a href="<?=absolute_url()?>events" class="text-decoration-none">Events</a> page for where we'll be next to come visit us,
      however, we can also send it right to your door if you aren't able to catch us at one of them. Just give us a shout and we'll send it out!
    </p>
    <!-- <p class="m3">
      We're also elated to make custom items just for you if it's a knitted, chrocheted, or chainmaille item
      and you can reach out to us at one of the linked email addresses on our <a href="<?=absolute_url()?>contact" class="text-decoration-none">Contact</a> page
      and we'll get back to your quickly with
