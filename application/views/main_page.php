    <h2 class="m3 center h4 italic">Handmade Nerdy &amp; Geeky Crafts</h2>
    <p class="m3 h3 bold">
      The only limit to our crafts is imagination! And the laws of physics, but we like to think it's only imagination.
    </p>
    <p class="m3 ampstart-dropcap">
      Whether you&#39;re looking for a piece of jewelry to subtly show off your nerdy side, a licensed character cotton or chainmaille bag to hold all those gaming dice,
      or a gift for that lovable geek in your life, 25th Hour Crafts has something just for you!
    </p>
    <p class="m3">
      Everything we sell is handmade by either Kayla or Scott and the ideas and fabric take ample hints from your favorite
      video game, movie, TV series, or book. Some of the ones we use as the material for our crafts are The Legend of Zelda,
      Pokemon, Mario, The Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Dr. Who, Star Trek, Game of Thrones, and Harry Potter.
    </p>
    <p class="m3">
      These hand-crafter items take the form of cute Amigurumi, licensed cotton drawstring or zipper bags, themed chainmail dicebags by using color palettes and patterns,
      comicbook hero logo earringsw like Wonder Woman, Batman, or Superman, and licensed fleece with a crocheted edge (we don't like how tied fleece looks either)
      and that's not even an exhaustive list of everything we can make.
    </p>
    <p class="m3">
      Many of these items we keep in stock for when we travel to conventions around the upper midwest
      so you can check out our events page for where we'll be next to come visit us,
      however we can also make something just for you and send it right to your door if you aren't able to catch us at one of them.
